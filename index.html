      <h2>
<a id="welcome-to-team-payload" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-team-payload" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Team Payload.</h2>

<p>This document should introduce you to the general Payload workflow and help you
get started as quickly as possible. Even if you hate reading, scan through this
document a few times because everyone's done it.</p>

<h2>
<a id="team-tools" class="anchor" href="#team-tools" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Team Tools</h2>

<p>We usually work with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Google Docs</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Email*</li>
<li>Gilani's place</li>
<li>Hangouts* or Skype*</li>
</ol>

<p>* RARELY</p>

<p><strong>Meetings waste time.</strong> We believe that meetings pull you from doing actual
work in order to talk about doing work. That is why we usually talk on chat,
and rarely use Skype.</p>

<h3>
<a id="slack" class="anchor" href="#slack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Slack</h3>

<p>All team comms happen on our <a href="https://payload.slack.com">slack.</a> The
slack domain is <code>payload.slack.com</code>, and you can use your <code>@payload.pk</code> email
address to sign up! Here are a few pointers on how to use slack:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Fill out your profile.</strong> Add a picture, your skype name, and phone number details. You can always
change it later.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>#Channels</strong> are where we discuss things. The names are self evident, but if
you're confused either read the channel's purpose, or <strong>ask.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>gilani:</strong> what're the #random and #music channel?</p>

<p><strong>sulaiman:</strong> anything non-work related is #random, and #music where we share
our jams, bro!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a></strong> people when you want to talk to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>gilani:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/paybot" class="user-mention">@paybot</a>: thanks</p>

<p><strong>paybot:</strong> don't mention it</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Paybot</strong> is our robot, he helps us automate things, if you'd like, you can
add features or play around with his code
<a href="https://github.com/payloadpk/paybot">here.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discuss everything on chat.</strong> Even if you're in the same room because a
transcript is helpful, and <a href="https://github.com/paybot" class="user-mention">@paybot</a> is a pretty helpful googler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chat is asynchronous.</strong> Asynchronous communication means you can step out
for lunch and catch up on transcripts when you get back. You can ask someone
a question in-chat and not worry about bothering them since she'll get back
to you when they're available.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="github" class="anchor" href="#github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Github</h3>

<p>All our code goes on our <a href="https://github.com/payloadpk">Github.</a> We encourage
pull requests and issues on any of our projects, and prefer to open source
things as we go. Unless it's extremely sensitive code, GPL, or AGPL it. If you're
unsure, <strong>ask.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Fill out your profile.</strong> Add a picture, maybe a bio, look nice!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a strong SSH key</strong> instead of your password to push commits, and follow
the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">Github Flow.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="google-docs" class="anchor" href="#google-docs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Google Docs</h3>

<p>We use Google Docs because it helps collaborate. Make sure people with links can
edit documents when you share them so that anyone can help, even later.</p>

<h3>
<a id="twitter" class="anchor" href="#twitter" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Twitter</h3>

<p>If someone does something nice, give them a shout out on Twitter. It may not
look like much, but it means a lot and
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TeamPayload">#TeamPayload loves Twitter</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="email" class="anchor" href="#email" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Email</h3>

<p>We're a small team, and we rarely use email to talk to each other, but in almost
every email we send, we CC the team with <code>team@payload.pk</code>. Just to keep
everyone in the loop about everything that happens.</p>

<h3>
<a id="google-hangouts-or-skype" class="anchor" href="#google-hangouts-or-skype" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Google Hangouts or Skype</h3>

<p>In the rare event that we can't meet up and need to talk over something, we use
Google Hangouts because Skype has really bad Linux support. But if Gilani's
not around, use Skype if you want.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-we-work" class="anchor" href="#how-we-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How we work</h2>

<p>We measure work by effort, not by hours. We work whenever we can.</p>

<p>Creative work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Think it in the morning</li>
<li>Build it in the afternoon.</li>
</ol>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finish a bit of your TODO</li>
<li>Gather feedback on existing projects</li>
<li>Add items on your TODO</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>Most importantly, when you want it, <strong>ask for help.</strong> However, understand by
doing that you'll be asking someone to focus on your work instead of theirs.
As a general rule, ask for help a little bit at a time.</p>

<p>We do regular informal performance reviews. Nothing to worry about, and we'll
share our concerns if we think you're shirking.</p>

<h2>
<a id="code-of-conduct" class="anchor" href="#code-of-conduct" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to
distil our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and
goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, in
everything you do.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Be considerate</strong></p>

<p>Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work
of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we
should consider them when making decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be respectful</strong></p>

<p>Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve
conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic
fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A team
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take responsibility for our words and our actions</strong></p>

<p>We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,
and work to right the wrong. A good place to start is by apologizing
privately and then, if the situation calls for it, publicly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be collaborative</strong></p>

<p>Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. We prefer to work
transparently and involve everyone as early as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus</strong></p>

<p>Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to
persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.
We expect participants to resolve disagreements constructively. When they
cannot, we escalate the matter to leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity
and direction. More often, we simply call a vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask for help when unsure</strong></p>

<p>Nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking questions early
avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be
directed to the appropriate person. Those who are asked should be responsive
and helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step down considerately</strong></p>

<p>When somebody leaves the project, we ask that they do so in a way that
minimizes disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving
and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left
off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
