{"name":"Payload Workflow","tagline":"An intro for newbies to #TeamPayload","body":"## Welcome to Team Payload.\r\nThis document should introduce you to the general Payload workflow and help you\r\nget started as quickly as possible. Even if you hate reading, scan through this\r\ndocument a few times because everyone's done it.\r\n\r\n## Team Tools\r\nWe usually work with:\r\n\r\n1. Slack\r\n2. Github\r\n3. Google Docs\r\n4. Twitter\r\n5. Email*\r\n6. Gilani's place\r\n7. Hangouts* or Skype*\r\n\r\n\\* RARELY\r\n\r\n**Meetings waste time.** We believe that meetings pull you from doing actual\r\nwork in order to talk about doing work. That is why we usually talk on chat,\r\nand rarely use Skype.\r\n\r\n### Slack\r\n\r\nAll team comms happen on our [slack.](https://payload.slack.com) The\r\nslack domain is `payload.slack.com`, and you can use your `@payload.pk` email\r\naddress to sign up! Here are a few pointers on how to use slack:\r\n\r\n1. **Fill out your profile.** Add a picture, your skype name, and phone number details. You can always\r\n    change it later.\r\n\r\n2. **#Channels** are where we discuss things. The names are self evident, but if\r\n    you're confused either read the channel's purpose, or **ask.**\r\n\r\n    >**gilani:** what're the #random and #music channel?\r\n    >\r\n    >**sulaiman:** anything non-work related is #random, and #music where we share\r\n    >our jams, bro!\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **@mention** people when you want to talk to them.\r\n\r\n    > **gilani:** @paybot: thanks\r\n    >\r\n    > **paybot:** don't mention it\r\n\r\n\r\n4. **Paybot** is our robot, he helps us automate things, if you'd like, you can\r\n    add features or play around with his code\r\n    [here.](https://github.com/payloadpk/paybot)\r\n\r\n5. **Discuss everything on chat.** Even if you're in the same room because a\r\n    transcript is helpful, and @paybot is a pretty helpful googler.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. **Chat is asynchronous.** Asynchronous communication means you can step out\r\n    for lunch and catch up on transcripts when you get back. You can ask someone\r\n    a question in-chat and not worry about bothering them since she'll get back\r\n    to you when they're available.\r\n\r\n### Github\r\n\r\nAll our code goes on our [Github.](https://github.com/payloadpk) We encourage\r\npull requests and issues on any of our projects, and prefer to open source\r\nthings as we go. Unless it's extremely sensitive code, GPL, or AGPL it. If you're\r\nunsure, **ask.**\r\n\r\n1. **Fill out your profile.** Add a picture, maybe a bio, look nice!\r\n\r\n2. **Use a strong SSH key** instead of your password to push commits, and follow\r\n    the [Github Flow.](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)\r\n\r\n### Google Docs\r\n\r\nWe use Google Docs because it helps collaborate. Make sure people with links can\r\nedit documents when you share them so that anyone can help, even later.\r\n\r\n### Twitter\r\n\r\nIf someone does something nice, give them a shout out on Twitter. It may not\r\nlook like much, but it means a lot and\r\n[#TeamPayload loves Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TeamPayload).\r\n\r\n### Email\r\n\r\nWe're a small team, and we rarely use email to talk to each other, but in almost\r\nevery email we send, we CC the team with `team@payload.pk`. Just to keep\r\neveryone in the loop about everything that happens.\r\n\r\n### Google Hangouts or Skype\r\n\r\nIn the rare event that we can't meet up and need to talk over something, we use\r\nGoogle Hangouts because Skype has really bad Linux support. But if Gilani's\r\nnot around, use Skype if you want.\r\n\r\n## How we work\r\n\r\nWe measure work by effort, not by hours. We work whenever we can.\r\n\r\nCreative work:\r\n\r\n1. Think it in the morning\r\n2. Build it in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nResponsibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Finish a bit of your TODO\r\n2. Gather feedback on existing projects\r\n3. Add items on your TODO\r\n5. Repeat\r\n\r\nMost importantly, when you want it, **ask for help.** However, understand by\r\ndoing that you'll be asking someone to focus on your work instead of theirs.\r\nAs a general rule, ask for help a little bit at a time.\r\n\r\nWe do regular informal performance reviews. Nothing to worry about, and we'll\r\nshare our concerns if we think you're shirking.\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nThis Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to\r\ndistil our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and\r\ngoals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, in\r\neverything you do.\r\n\r\n1. **Be considerate**\r\n\r\n   Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work\r\n   of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we\r\n   should consider them when making decisions.\r\n\r\n2. **Be respectful**\r\n\r\n   Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve\r\n   conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic\r\n   fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A team\r\n   where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\r\n\r\n3. **Take responsibility for our words and our actions**\r\n\r\n   We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If\r\n   someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,\r\n   and work to right the wrong. A good place to start is by apologizing\r\n   privately and then, if the situation calls for it, publicly.\r\n\r\n4. **Be collaborative**\r\n\r\n   Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.\r\n   Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. We prefer to work\r\n   transparently and involve everyone as early as possible.\r\n\r\n5. **Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus**\r\n\r\n   Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to\r\n   persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.\r\n   We expect participants to resolve disagreements constructively. When they\r\n   cannot, we escalate the matter to leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity\r\n   and direction. More often, we simply call a vote.\r\n\r\n6. **Ask for help when unsure**\r\n\r\n   Nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking questions early\r\n   avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be\r\n   directed to the appropriate person. Those who are asked should be responsive\r\n   and helpful.\r\n\r\n7. **Step down considerately**\r\n\r\n   When somebody leaves the project, we ask that they do so in a way that\r\n   minimizes disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving\r\n   and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left\r\n   off.\r\n\r\n## Attributions\r\nThis doc was started by [@amingilani](https://twitter.com/amingilani) and\r\ncontributed to by [people.](https://github.com/payloadpk/workflow-intro/graphs/contributors) It uses material from:\r\n\r\n1.
