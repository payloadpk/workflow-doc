## Welcome to Team Payload.
This document should introduce you to the general Payload workflow and help you
get started as quickly as possible. Even if you hate reading, scan through this
document a few times because everyone's done it.

## Team Tools
We usually work with:

1. Slack
2. Github
3. Google Docs
4. Twitter
5. Email*
6. Gilani's place
7. Hangouts* or Skype*

\* RARELY

**Meetings waste time.** We believe that meetings pull you from doing actual
work in order to talk about doing work. That is why we usually talk on chat,
and rarely use Skype.

### Slack

All team comms happen on our [slack.](https://payload.slack.com) The
slack domain is `payload.slack.com`, and you can use your `@payload.pk` email
address to sign up! Here are a few pointers on how to use slack:

1. **Fill out your profile**

    Add a picture, your skype name, and phone number details. You can always
    change it later.

2. **#Channels** are where we discuss things. The names are self evident, but if
    you're confused either read the channel's purpose, or **ask.**
    ```
    gilani: what're the #random and #music channel?
    sulaiman: anything non-work related is #random, and #music where we share
    our jams, bro!
    ```

3. **@mention** people when you want to talk to them.
    ```
    gilani: @paybot: thanks
    paybot: don't mention it
    ```

4. **Paybot** is our robot, he helps us automate things, if you'd like, you can
    add features or play around with his code
    [here.](https://github.com/payloadpk/paybot)

5. **Discuss everything on chat.** Even if you're in the same room because a
    transcript is helpful, and @paybot is a pretty helpful googler.


6. **Chat is asynchronous.** Asynchronous communication means you can step out
    for lunch and catch up on transcripts when you get back. You can ask someone
    a question in-chat and not worry about bothering them since she'll get back
    to you when they're available.

### Github

All our code goes on our [Github.](https://github.com/payloadpk) We encourage
pull requests and issues on any of our projects, and prefer to open source
things as we go. Unless it's extremely sensitive code, GPL, or AGPL it. If you're
unsure, **ask.**

1. **Fill out your profile**
    Add a picture, maybe a bio, look nice!

2. **Use a strong SSH key** instead of your password to push commits, and follow
    the [Github Flow.](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

### Google Docs

We use Google Docs because it helps collaborate. Make sure people with links can
edit documents when you share them so that anyone can help, even later.

### Twitter

If someone does something nice, give them a shout out on Twitter. It may not
look like much, but it means a lot and
[#TeamPayload loves Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TeamPayload).

### Email

We're a small team, and we rarely use email to talk to each other, but in almost
every email we send, we CC the team with `team@payload.pk`. Just to keep
everyone in the loop about everything that happens.

### Google Hangouts or Skype

In the rare event that we can't meet up and need to talk over something, we use
Google Hangouts because Skype has really bad Linux support. But if Gilani's
not around, use Skype if you want.

## How we work

We measure work by effort, not by hours. We work whenever we can.

Creative work:

1. Think it in the morning
2. Build it in the afternoon.

Responsibilities:

1. Finish a bit of your TODO
2. Gather feedback on existing projects
3. Add items on your TODO
5. Repeat

Most importantly, when you want it, **ask for help.** However, understand by
doing that you'll be asking someone to focus on your work instead of theirs.
As a general rule, ask for help a little bit at a time.

We do regular informal performance reviews. Nothing to worry about, and we'll
share our concerns if we think you're shirking.

## Code of Conduct

This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to
distil our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and
goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, in
everything you do.

1. **Be considerate**

   Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work
   of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we
   should consider them when making decisions.

2. **Be respectful**

   Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve
   conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic
   fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A team
   where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

3. **Take responsibility for our words and our actions**

   We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
   someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,
   and work to right the wrong. A good place to start is by apologizing
   privately and then, if the situation calls for it, publicly.

4. **Be collaborative**

   What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts. Collaboration between
   teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to
   be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to
   understand the whole.

   Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
   Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever
   possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free
   software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently
   and involve interested parties as early as possible.

5. **Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus**

   Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to
   persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.
   We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements
   constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to leaders to
   arbitrate and provide clarity and direction. More often, we simply call a
   vote.

6. **Ask for help when unsure**

   Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early
   avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be
   directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive
   and helpful.

7. **Step down considerately**

   When somebody leaves the project, we ask that they do so in a way that
   minimizes disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving
   and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left
   off.
